# Agent Skills System

OmniCoreAgent supports the **Agent Skills** specification — self-contained capability packages that provide specialized knowledge, executable scripts, and comprehensive documentation for agents.

## What is an Agent Skill?

An agent skill is a directory following a specific structure that packages everything an agent needs to perform specialized tasks. Skills allow you to build portable, reusable capabilities that can be shared across agents and projects.

### Directory Structure

```text
.agents/skills/my-skill-name/
├── SKILL.md        # The "Activation" document (instructions + metadata)
├── scripts/        # Multi-language executable scripts (Python, JS, etc.)
├── references/     # Deep-dive documentation and research
└── assets/         # Templates, examples, and other resources
```

---

## Configuration

Enable skill discovery in the agent configuration:

```python
agent_config = {
    "enable_agent_skills": True  # Enable discovery and tools for skills
}

agent = OmniCoreAgent(
    ...
    agent_config=agent_config
)
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Discovery**: The agent automatically scans the `.agents/skills/` directory at startup.
2. **Activation**: The agent is instructed to read the `SKILL.md` file first to understand the skill's capabilities and how to use them.
3. **Execution**: The agent uses specialized tools to interact with skill files and run scripts.

### Skill-Specific Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_skill_file` | Access any file within a skill (docs, references, etc.). |
| `run_skill_script` | Execute bundled scripts with automatic interpreter detection. |

---

## Polyglot Script Execution

The `run_skill_script` tool supports multiple languages, allowing you to bridge different ecosystems:

- **Python** (.py)
- **JavaScript / Node.js** (.js)
- **TypeScript** (.ts)
- **Ruby** (.rb)
- **Bash / Shell** (.sh)

The framework automatically detects the correct interpreter and passes arguments from the agent to your script.

### Tips for Skill Authors

- **Clear Metadata**: Ensure your `SKILL.md` has a clear "Purpose" and "Usage" section.
- **Example Driven**: Include examples of successful tool calls or script executions.
- **Portable Scripts**: Avoid hardcoded paths in your scripts; use the environment and arguments provided by the agent.
